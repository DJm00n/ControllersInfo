# USB Connection

USB-C port for charging, wired gameplay, and Tandem Mode.

TODO

# Bluetooth Connection

Bluetooth Low Energy 4.2 (BLE).

You have until December 31, 2023 to enable Bluetooth mode using the web-based update tool at [stadia.google.com/controller](https://stadia.google.com/controller/)

In Bluetooth mode, you can use **Tandem Mode** to connect a second controller to your wirelessly connected Stadia Controller.

After you enable Bluetooth mode on your Stadia Controller, you can connect it to a device, like a computer or mobile phone.

## Pair

Press and hold the **Stadia button** until it turns off and then press and hold the **Stadia button** until the status light pulses orange.

Note: If the status light doesn't pulse orange, hold the **Stadia button** and **Y button** simultaneously for 2 seconds.
On the device you want to connect to, open its settings and then go to Bluetooth settings and then select the device containing the word "Stadia".
If the controller won't pair after performing these steps, you might have to approve the controller on your device's Bluetooth menu. If you still have problems pairing or connecting your controller to a device, refer to the device's manufacturer for instructions.
After your Stadia Controller connects wirelessly to a device, its status light will turn solid white.

## Tandem mode

To use Tandem Mode, plug a second controller into your Stadia Controller's USB port. Inputs from both controllers are registered as if they're coming from your primary Stadia Controller. This means you and a second player can play in a cooperative "friend mode" where you share a game's inputs.

- Turn on your Stadia Controller. Make sure it's paired and connected wirelessly to a device.
- Make sure the secondary controller is charged and turned off.
- Use a USB cable to connect the secondary controller to your Stadia Controller's USB-C port.

If you use a USB A-to-C adapter, connect the adapter side to your primary controller. If you connect two Stadia Controllers, power down the second controller before plugging it in.

Note: To use vibration on the primary controller in Tandem Mode, press and hold the down button **Down button on the Direction Pad** while connecting the second controller and then hold it for 3 seconds after connecting.

# Troubleshooting

## Recover an unresponsive Stadia Controller

If your Stadia Controller won't connect to a device, try the following steps before you perform a hardware reset.

- Use a functional charger and USB-C cable to plug your Stadia Controller into a power source for 30 minutes.
- With the controller off, hold down the **Y button** and then press the **Stadia button** for ten seconds and then release the button.
- Press and hold the **Stadia button** for 2 seconds or plug it into a power source.

## Turn your Stadia Controller off and on again

If your Stadia Controller is paired wirelessly to a device with Bluetooth or connected with a USB cable and you want to stop using it:

- Press and hold the **Stadia button** for 4 seconds.
- The controller will rumble and its status light will turn off.

To turn your controller back on:
- For a wired connection, plug your controller back into your computer or mobile device.
- For a wireless link, press and hold the **Stadia button** until the controller rumbles.

## Factory reset your controller

If you experience issues with your Stadia Controller and the steps above don't help, perform a factory reset:

- Make sure your Stadia Controller is on.
- Press and hold the **Google Assistant Assistant button** and **Capture button** buttons simultaneously for 6 seconds.
- The controller will vibrate and the status light will blink.

Note: After you perform a factory reset, you'll need to re-pair your controller to devices over Bluetooth.

## My Stadia Controller won't turn on. How can I fix it?

If your controller won't turn on, its battery might be drained. Plug it into a computer or power outlet to charge it. If that doesn't work:

- Unplug your Stadia Controller.
- Press and hold the **Stadia button** for 10 seconds to reset the controller.
- Press and hold the **Stadia button** until the status light turns on.
